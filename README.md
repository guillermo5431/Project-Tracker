Your website is designed to help customers track the progress of their 
projects in real time. With a secure login system, users can access 
their personal dashboard, view ongoing projects, and monitor 
completion status. Each project is assigned a unique ticket number, 
allowing customers to quickly look up project details without hassle.

For transparency, the system provides progress updates, either as 
clear development stages (e.g., Design, Development, Testing) or a 
numerical percentage (e.g., 75% complete). This ensures that 
customers always know how close their project is to completion.

Key Features:
✅ User Dashboard – Displays active projects and their status.
✅ Project Lookup – Customers can search for projects using ticket numbers.
✅ Admin Panel – Admins can update progress, manage users, and oversee projects.
✅ Secure Login System – Ensures only authorized users access project details.

The goal is to streamline project communication, enhance transparency, and reduce unnecessary customer inquiries by providing a self-service tracking system.
